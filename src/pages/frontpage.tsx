                    <p>Distant Dollar was designed and implemented from scratch by Dylan Leddy and Blake Prall. As seniors studying computer science at Boston College, we sought to leverage our technical skills to provide our friends a platform to effortlessly manage their finances. While Distant Dollar is technically functional, we are not experts and it's ill advised to view this platform as more than a portfolio website.</p>
